 *  PixLab graded methods
 *  For this task you will complete two Picture filters for the PixLab.
 *  1) You will fully implement the anselAdams method which increases the black/white
 *      contrast of a grayscale image.
 *  2) You will implement 2 helper methods to make the andyWarhol method work as expected.
 *      a) primaryColors converts every Pixel in the image to a "primary color"
 *      b) rotateColors converts "primary colors" of an image to a different "primary color"
 *  
 *  For this project: a primary color is defined as a color with color codes that are either 0 or 255 only.
